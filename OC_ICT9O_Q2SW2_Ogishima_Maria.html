				The Hokkaido Inu (or Hokkaido Ken) is said to have an older lineage than other Japanese breeds. Hailing from Japan's northernmost island, the Hokkaido Inu has a thicker outer coat, larger legs, and smaller ears to help them withstand the freezing cold.Smart, strong and dedicated, the Hokkaido Inu was bred to be a hunting dog, able to handle wild boar and even cubs. Therefore, they continue to be a very stubborn breed and can show aggression towards other dogs. They tend to develop a very strong bond with their owners and need a lot of attention.</td>

				The Kai Ken is one of Japan's most distinctive dog breeds. It's easy to see why they are affectionately nicknamed "tiger dogs" because of their coat color. Kai Kens were bred to hunt wild animals, including wild boar, deer and poultry. Since this breed originated in the mountainous regions of Japan, it evolved very quickly with well-developed muscles. They are also extremely intelligent, learn quickly, and tend to be quite independent, although they love to please their owners.</td>
